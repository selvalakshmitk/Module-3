# Strings-Palindrome Check in Python (Without Built-in Functions)

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
o write a Python program to check whether the string "malayalam" is a palindrome or not, without using built-in palindrome checking functions.

ðŸ§  Algorithm
Assign the string "malayalam" to a variable.
Reverse the string manually using slicing ([::-1]).
Compare the original string with the reversed string.
If they are equal, print that the string is a palindrome.
Otherwise, print that it is not a palindrome.
Execute the program.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
s1="malayalam"

s2=s1[::-1]

if s1==s2:

print("The entered string is palindrome")

else:

print("The entered string is not palindrome")

## Result
Thus, To write a Python program to check whether the string "google" is a palindrome or not, without using built-in palindrome checking functions is verified
