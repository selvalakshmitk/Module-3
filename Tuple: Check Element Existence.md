# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element '52' and the element 12 exist within a given tuple.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a tuple tuplex with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the in operator to check if the string '52' exists within the tuple.
3. Use the in operator to check if the integer 12 exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
tuplex =("12", 8, "21", "10", "11", "52", "u", "r", "c", "e")

print("52" in tuplex)

print("12"Â inÂ tuplex)

## Result
Thus, Python program that checks if the element '52' and the element 12 exist within a given tuple is excuted and verified.
